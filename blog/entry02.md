# Gathered so far #
i have learned that during my reaserches in foresnic science I have gathered lots of information and that some of them in which i thought where not a lot of important and some of them i thought were a lot interesting but some were very confusing and complext to understand it but with it being said i liked the ideas that some of the things that i researched such as the softwares and hardwares that I researched the softwares were a little hard ot find of somesorts because the things about foresnic science is that they mostly use **hardwares** like gadjets of sorts and that I would believe that the **softwares** are mostly for the people who wanted to learn more about the topic of foresnic sciences and that how they can apply and get thier way into the profession, although there were some good things about the softwares with some help keeping data in check in which its really helpful sicne most of the gadjets that the scientists use they mostly rely on data and how much they can store into one. There is plenty and many of the hardware that comes around with the hardware, with it helping them in lots with combining technology and engineering together to create something incredible for one to use to analyze and help collect data with finger analysis to identify a person to collecting chemicals that we can use for evidence to scan photos to even advanced technology that brings back a person's face of its reconstruction.

# Softwares #
Like I briefly said about the software that was involved with the research, it clearly somewhat helped, but mostly on how the Western society works and how they are run. There are a few, but these were the ones that I understood and picked out.

The first software i looked at was the [sleuth Kit](https://www.sleuthkit.org/)

-Ki.jpgt 
-It's a collection of command line tools.
-Helps analyze disk images/help recover files from it.
-It's used behind the scenes of Autopsy.
-It also helps them train for the field in (Forensic Autopsy )

The second Software i looked at was SIFT [SANS investigative forensic toolkit](https://www.sans.org/tools/sift-workstation/)

-SIFT.png 
-Used to help perform detailed digital forensic examinations in many different ways.
-Can match any current incident response in any forensic tool suite.
-This way investigations can be conducted much faster, as also a great 
-organizer as it avoids evidence getting mixed up, with the systems being fairly easy to use.
-It's not as pricey as the other forensic software on the market.

The third software i looked at was [forensic toolkit](https://www.exterro.com/forensic-toolkit)

-FTK.svg
-It can create a full disk image with a wide range of process data types.
-Can help you get clearer pictures of the images/events. Including the location and the type of device used to capture the image.
-It can make files/system information easier to read.
-Can also help you locate, manage and also filter out the mobile data much easier too.

Of course its not just these three there is just so many others that i would consider using with the foresnic science softwares as i would like to say to play aournd with these websites a bit and ot see how thye work in yuor best opinion and how they would be of help. The apps that I found were not all good but somewhat at best to teach about this kind of topic as a lot of them seems to be focusing on the body parts of that part of the science Although i don't have the exact names of these apps because the time i researched for these apps i rarely found any signs of any actually which makes it more of a difficult for me to work with.

# Hardware #
Hardware, in my opinion, is one of the most important things that I would consider to be necessary. In order to gather evidence and perform it to your best, you need good gadgets so that you can perform well and gather lots and lots of data for the person to use during court. It's one of the main things that scientists use today. It does all sorts of things, and each unique technology that is mixed with some sort of at least enjeeneering process with it being indivisual is all different.
As such, as described below:

**Facial reconstruction**, This can, of course, help us determine the person’s face, even if it's too damaged, as it can still reconstruct what it was before.Automated fingerprint recognition to get that perfect impression of print without compromising the fingerprint, and of course helps identify people, with it being used for a long time since the 1980s.

**Drug testing** To identify unknown substances, whether they be pills, powders, or liquids, they can use a color test to determine what drug is represented there.La-ICP-MS, Its a strong analysis that directly performs on the solid objects or samples that can tell you what kind of materials it matches up with it being shown up in just a few seconds.**Fire 

technology** As it is used to determine if the incident is either accidental, natural, or deliberate, they apply heat to their samples as they use it to further determine the chemical structures.

**A 3D scanner** is expensive equipment, but it does its job as it scans the room in 360°, taking pictures of the objects within it as it measures the distance from the scanner, which is mostly useful as back then people used hand-drawn pictures.

These are not even half of the gadgets that I described above, but these are some of the advanced technology that they have for us that we can use to help solve our crime cases. Gadgets like these are the reasons that we are learning more about the field of science that is new to us.

# EDP #
In my current stage, I would be "defying the problem." As said in my other previous blog about that, I was researching to find out about the things that people need or don't need, and now that I have figured out that the field of scientific science people is that they don't really have high-quality evidence, I must ask: what is the low evidence? well data, and how they are analyzed as such DNA, it is hard to make a valid claim about a DNA once it is discovered. The DNA samples might be small, and they might not provide much with them, leading to errors that we might experience. and with some of its poor-quality samples at hand too. In my next plan for the "engineering design process," i would be narrowing it down to the things that have to do with data collection and the quality of the evidence that it produces, and how many of those things are really provided for the team of scientists to do such work. As in this stage, I would still define myself as "defining the problem," in which I need to find the cause and why there are such problems in this kind of field.

# SKILLs #
As of right now, the only skill that I would need is the ability to store as much information about scientific science as I possibly can and to use my brain to think. The **writing** skill would be really good, as I can write all about what I have researched through my findings, helping myself with those information, taking notes, and getting ready for my next progress. I would need to **organize** my notes then to make my life possible for me to be able to understand where I may have left off and where I can start again. **Time** would not seem like a big deal, but to me, I have been getting into activities and that I would need time to sort all my schedules out and help myself to the point where I need to do my research because this is going to be a lot.
