# Context
For my freedom project, I chose the website "[Aframe](https://aframe.io/)" because, after I just explored the website, I fell in love with the things that it can do. I have seen how people used the website to their own advantage and to create many beautiful things that were made out of shapes, such as popular VR games that were also made using Aframe. As such, I didn't know the games like "Beat Saber" were created using the website. It was interesting to see how people can get so creative with the website itself and use it to their full advantage, making it work for them. I kind of wish I had the power to also use it in my hands. The website itself looked very appealing, too. When I first arrived at their front page, I was mesmerized by the small animations and the simple designs that they built into each one, as that was one of the reasons that caught my attention to this website, apart from the other reasons being about how they displayed their achievements and how other people used them as well and made a living profit off of them.

## tinkered? 
The way I thought about it was very simple, as it didn't require much force since they already provided some code on their website for you to try it out. The code itself consisted of 4 different 3D shapes that we could ourselves change the width, height, and x and y values of in the directions. We could experiment with them and really just play along with the code to see what they do and how they work in our hands. It's almost like a simple demo that they give for new people to experience what their website would be like.

## how did you tinkered with it?
I start tinkering with the code by copying and pasting it onto [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/qewayukotu/edit?html,output), and from there, I start working with my way into the code, and that is how I myself would change about the code. As myself had also worked with these kinds of shapes below, I just played around with the code and started changing bits like the height and width to see how far they would go and the limits that they could reach. I changed the X and Y values to see how they would move around, and it was really fun to see how the shapes change by just adjusting a few numbers in the code.

# EDP
]The EDP(Engeneering Design Process) that I am on now is mostly due to the fact that I am starting to fix some errors in how my topic is going to be presented and make sure that it is well proven and double checked so I can make sure that the product is actually something useful for society and make it presentable and more appealing, while also describing how it will be made and how we can further look into how we can combine all the things smoothly without having a roadblock and having to redo everything.

# Skills
The skills I need on this are very important, because if the code is about the shapes and how we can create them to move and such, I would feel like the skill would be mostly off the design that we can make using this kind of code. I saw how people used [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) for 3D shapes like these and how they molded it and used it to create unique designs that came with it. With creativity, I would feel like I could create my own design with the shapes available and attach it to anything I wanted. (As long as my imagination goes.)
And I can also see that this requires basic knowledge of CSS since these shapes are part of design, and I have a brave gut feeling that I will also be applying CSS to these shapes when I am in the middle of the design process, along with HTML to go with it too. (coding, but with shapes instead)
