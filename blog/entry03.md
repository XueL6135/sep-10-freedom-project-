## ( what i have imporved so far with my data collection ) 
---
with the past blog talking about my _software and hardware_* I needed something of a way to help myself sort out the different devices and websites without them not bunching together as it is going to be difficult for me to look at my information and think of ideas needed. I sorted them into **categories** of **Less complexity to more complexity**. with the organization of these categories, I can bring storm something new about them as each category talks about the tools how they are used and how often would scientists use them to solve cases most likely in my predictions. These predictions may come off as wrong but I would say in this situation predictions are more helpful in the science field. With all these categories I have developed three ideas of my own that I would think would help more in forensics science with it being Gadgets and even high technology products. Of course, these products are made for data collecting since in my last walk I talked about how [data](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/the-problem-with-forensic-sciences#:~:text=And%20while%20there%20are%20some,quality%20evidence%2C%20contamination%20or%20bias.) was a big issue and how they are not in the biggest quality of Forensic science.

## progress

With my Now of **Engineering Design Process**, I have developed 3 ideas right now of what could help society of 
Forensic science and how it can make things easier for us to solve cases of criminals. My ideas are not technically the best but it was technically decent as far as the quality evidence-capturing devices that are handy right now. Mainly describing what the device is how it can help us in the field of forensic science and how it can improve our workspace to make things easier for ourselves. some may be dangerous but in most the gadgets are mostly safe from any physical harm to the human body.

### Idea #1 

My _first idea_ is about the future of these gadgets right now are mostly infused with technology like **sensors** that sense of what you're doing such as the Apple watch as I can basically do anything but also those like tracker watches that keeps track of how many steps you take or how many miles you have run to keep your heartbeat in check most of these are just [mobile devices](https://dgaps.com/mobile-data-collection-trends-and-predictions-523#:~:text=IoT%20devices%20like%20sensors%20and,manual%20input%20and%20improving%20accuracy.)that you just wear so the idea is I have or at least one of them includes this kind of sensing technology with it being a bracelet of a kind that tracks your data and how you are in the basic activities that you have had as it As accurately tracks down of what you're doing most of the time it's about 70% right and that it can help us a lot with solving cases with just knowing the recent events that the person had or was doing so it helps us collect more data of the scene itself.

### idea #2

My _second idea_ is not as I would say "safe" as the first one because my second idea is on the topic of [microchips](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2022-09/microchips-in-humans-consumer-friendly-app-or-new-frontier-in-surveillance/) and how that we can use this to our advantage although it's not as safe or in security I would feel like if we can develop a chip that is safe enough for humans to be _implanted_ into we can make a big step and help us collect more data of the things around them and how we can use these evidence in cases and prove that the person did this type of **activity** as I feel like microchips serve us moreover as a lie detector.

### idea 3

My _third idea_ that I have come up with is a [camera](https://blog.oncamgrandeye.com/news/how-high-resolution-cameras-big-data-analytics-are-impacting-video-storage-needs) but it's not as the same of a phone camera, It can basically **detect and scan** it all how it works is that the camera takes a photo of the scene and it basically scans all the things that are inside of what's in a photo and cuts them apart of each object and help individualize them, it's about seeing the surroundings of your _environments_ of the thing that you are working in as the camera can provide good quality photos and make sure it is as clear with its very high technology of it's zooming in effect and help us capture the littlest things that we might not even see with the naked human eye. As I find this more efficient and quick and easy to use.

# Skills

Right now I will be more focused on organize session of my skills as I think probably that would be the best skill to use right now considering that I need to organize my ideas of websites gadgets Hardware software into different categories and salt them out so that it won't be a whole jumbled mess together so I can look at the data that I have collected more in a simpler easier way while also not to confuse myself within these information. I would also say time management will be useful in this because when you organize things I feel like you would take up a lot of time and I have a lot of other things to do as well besides organizing this information so I need to manage my time well and I need to plan it out on how I'm going to do this without not forgetting the steps that I have taken before.
