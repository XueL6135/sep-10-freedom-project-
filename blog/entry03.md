## ( what i have imporved so far with my data collection ) 
---
with the past blog talking about my _softwares and hardwares_* I needed something of a way to help myself sort our the different devices and websites with them not bunching otgether as it is going ot be difficult for me to look at my information and think of ideas of needed. I sorted them into **categories** of **Less complexity to more complexity**. with the organization of these categories I can bring storm something new about them as with each category it talks about the tools and how they are used and like how often would scientists use them to solve cases most likely in my predictions. These predictions may come off as wrong but I would say in this situation predictions are more helpful in the science field. With all these categories I have developed three ideas of my own that I would think would help more in foresnic science with it being Gadgets and even high technology products. Of course these products are made for data collecting since in my last walk I've talked about on how [data](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/the-problem-with-forensic-sciences#:~:text=And%20while%20there%20are%20some,quality%20evidence%2C%20contamination%20or%20bias.) was a big issue and how they are not in the biggest quality of Forensic science.

## progress

With my Now of **Engeerneering Desgin Process** , I have developed 3 ideas of right now of what could help society of Foresnic science more and how it can make thinga esier for us to solve cases in criminals. My ideas are not technically the best but it was technically decent as far of the quality evidence capturing devices that are handy in right of now. Mainlt describing of what the device is and how it can help us in the field of foresnic science and how it can imoprve our workspace to make things easier for ourselves. some may be of dangerous but in most the gadjets are mostly sadfe from any physical harm to the human body.

### Idea #1 

My _first idea_ is about the future of these gadgets right now are mostly infused with technology like **sensors** that senses of what you're doing such as the Apple watch as I can basically do anything but in also those like tracker watches it keeps track of how many steps you take or how many miles you have run to keep your heartbeat in check most of these are really just [mobile devices](https://dgaps.com/mobile-data-collection-trends-and-predictions-523#:~:text=IoT%20devices%20like%20sensors%20and,manual%20input%20and%20improving%20accuracy.) that you just wear so the idea is I have or at least one of them includes these kind of sensing technology with it being a bracelet of a kind that basically tracks your data and how you are in the basic activites that you have had as it As accurately tracks down of what you're doing most of the time it's about 70% right and that it can help us a lot with solving cases with with just knowing the recent events that the person had or was doing so it helps us collect more data of the scene itself.

### idea #2

With my _second idea_ not as i would say "safe" as the first one because for my second idea it on the topic about [microchips](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2022-09/microchips-in-humans-consumer-friendly-app-or-new-frontier-in-surveillance/) and how that we can use this to our advantage although it's not as safe or in security but I would feel like if we can develop a chip that is safe enough for humans to be _implanted_ into we can make a big step and help us collect more data of the things around them and how we can use these evidence in cases and prove that the person actually did this type of **activity** as I feel like microchips serves us moreover as a lie detector.

### idea 3

My _third idea_ that I have come up with is a [camera](https://blog.oncamgrandeye.com/news/how-high-resolution-cameras-big-data-analytics-are-impacting-video-storage-needs) but its not as teh same of a phone camera, It can basically **detect and scan** it all how it works is that the camera takes a photo of the scene and it basically scans all the things that are inside of what's in a photo and cuts them apart of each individual object and help individualize them basically it's about seeing the surroundings of your _environments_ of the thing that you are working in as the camera can provide good quality photos and make sure it is as clear with it's also very high technology of it's zooming in effect help us capture the littlest things that we might not even see with the naked human eye. As i find this more efficeint and quick and easy to us.

# Skills

Obviously right now I will more focused on organize session of my skill as I think probably that would be the best skill to use right now considering that I need to organize my ideas of websites gadgets Hardware softwares into different categories and salt them out so that it won't be a whole jumbled mess together so I can look at my data that I myself have collected more in a simpler easier way while also not to confuse myself within these information. I would also say time management will be useful in this because when you organize things I feel like you would take up a lot of time and myself I have a lot of other things to do as well besides organizing these information so I need to manage my time well and I need to plan it out on how I'm going to do this without not forgetting the steps that I have taken before.
