# Choosing my Topic #

I chose my topic of **forensic science** as i have a wide passionate of interesting on what the inside of the body looks like with the effects of how it occured, whenever i was little i would go very serious into when they talk about solving cases as those have lots of drama in my opinion im just fairly interested in the crimes that people are involved with and that with me maybe taking a part in it makes it more interesting. Its not too much but for me alwasy blood and gore has alwasy been my favorite shows like those crazy Emergency room hospital shows i would always be up to know the cause of what happended and the full story behind it. I liked science as it was the only subject in which i can go beyound some of my thinking and actually explore new things that are connected behind the topic of specific things. **"crimes"**, are also very interesting as gathering evidence requires hard work but with my _skills_ and perks i think i can handle a task with that. 

Some links that i used for my reasearch would be on a [Overview on forensic science](https://www.nist.gov/forensic-science#:~:text=What%20Is%20Forensic%20Science%3F,to%20anthropology%20and%20wildlife%20forensics) on the basics of what it is then i used a more [detailed Website](https://www.aafs.org/careers-forensic-science/what-forensic-science) on descrbing the thigs you do in fornesic science and that it tells you about the career of it and it even says how much you get paid. Then i researched what forensic has on our society and how does it [provide for the crimes](https://www.strose.edu/forensic-science/forensic-science-criminal-justice/#:~:text=Forensic%20science%20provides%20the%20criminal,further%20analysis%20in%20a%20laboratory.) that are invovled. As of course in order to create and need something that i might create i would look up the [technologies](https://www.atascientific.com.au/technologies-forensic-sciences/#:~:text=Forensic%20scientists%20apply%20technologies%20to,then%20analysed%20using%20gas%20chromatography.) that are already there that to make sure i won't do something that was already done, in the mean time i can learn morea about these technologies and how they work.

# EDP #

The _Engineering Design Process_ might be a bit long as the **first step of defining** that im on which is actually knowing the field of the career and the job behind it has a lot of meaning and i need to a lot of research in order to actually know what forensic science actually is, But so far with the links that i found i would think myself on a good place of not to worry about gathering imformation as i already know about the topic and as i look into the technologies behind it. The **second step** would be on the real **ENP**, in which im still working on that as i research more about what problems are there in the fornesic science industry and what they still **need to solve** or what **they don't have** that i might just use that chance and think of a way to solve it as the design process might use a lot of time but i think with the time, it would be worth it to find something that wasn't there before.

# skills #

Some of the skills that i think i have to make this project work is that when it comes to projects like these i will try and do collabrative work and maybe get inspirational projects from others as that includes _socializing_, I can also manage my _time_ quite well, i can also _organize_ pretty well, and i can use my _imagination_ with great effect with along designing of _art_ in which its one of my habits, as im also quite good in the _writing_ catagory in case i need to take notes.

## More in detail about my Skills ##

**Socializing**

Either with strangers i can socalize pretty well if they are in the same topic as me and that we can use the time of spending together and solve problems that we both find interesting in. In the socialize class i would say im pretty good as Even if theres only one person in the room i would still at least try and get their attention and get along with them.

**time**

Timw to me is very important as i need to schedule plans and gatherthings most of the time with only myself to help and sometimes it won't come out like i wanted it to but most 90% of the time i can manage time just like today i went for volunteering i asked about what time they start which is about 3-6PM, since my one of my friends doesn't want to go alone, i made myself time as i have clubs on the days she wanted to go but i think with it being ending at 3:30 i can go pretty well on about leaving the club around 3:20 and get their early as 3:40 , in which its enough time for us to work as long. and i would always to make sure i have enough time fo rmy own needs too.

**oraganize**

usually i would organize for myself but now i'm helping others to organize their things too, just as the start of the year i was asked by my ELA teacher ot help and organize his drawers i agreed because back at home i almost do this all the time as i have sections of things for everything.

**Imagination and Art**

I would combine these skills together becuase i inmagine a lot and in my imaginations i would sometimes design them out on a piece of paper and i would call tht art as i add more details into my design, whatever is on m y mind i will make it into a reality somehow.

**writing**

I liked to write a lot with lots and lots of details included, i just like takingnotes in general and hope to understand more throughout my own understand of writing.

# Summary #

Overall of all these thinking i would say im pretty intrigued by this topic that i loved to do as its my first time and my first thing that i actually love and passtionate about with science which i hope i can learn more about the human body and get better understanding of it and hope i can imagine in a serious and experimenting field one day that i can both identify body wounds and parts with the meaning behind it!
