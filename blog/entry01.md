# Choosing my Topic #

I chose my topic of **forensic science** as I have a wide passion for and interest in what the inside of the body looks like with the effects of how it occurred. Whenever I was little, I would go very seriously when they talked about solving cases, as those have lots of drama. In my opinion, I'm just fairly interested in the crimes that people are involved with, and maybe taking part in them makes them more interesting. It's not too much, but for me, Blood and Gore has always been my favorite show. Like those crazy emergency room hospital shows, I would always want to know the cause of what happened and the full story behind it. I liked science as it was the only subject in which I could go beyond some of my thinking and actually explore new things that were connected to the topic of specific things. **"Crimes"**, are also very interesting, as gathering evidence requires hard work, but with my skills and perks, I think I can handle a task with that. 

Some links that i used for my research would be on a [Overview on forensic science](https://www.nist.gov/forensic-science#:~:text=What%20Is%20Forensic%20Science%3F,to%20anthropology%20and%20wildlife%20forensics) on the basics of what it is, then i used a more [detailed website](https://www.aafs.org/careers-forensic-science/what-forensic-science) on describing the things you do in fornesic science and that it tells you about the career of it and it even says how much you get paid Then I researched what forensics has on our society and how it provides for crimes using [this link](https://www.strose.edu/forensic-science/forensic-science-criminal-justice/#:~:text=Forensic%20science%20provides%20the%20criminal,further%20analysis%20in%20a%20laboratory.) that are involved. As of course, in order to create and need something that I might create, I would look up the [technologies](https://www.atascientific.com.au/technologies-forensic-sciences/#:~:text=Forensic%20scientists%20apply%20technologies%20to,then%20analysed%20using%20gas%20chromatography.) that are already there to make sure I wouldn't do something that was already done. In the meantime, I can learn more about these technologies and how they work.

The _Engineering Design Process_ might be a bit long, as the **first step of defining** that I am on, which is actually knowing the field of the career and the job behind it, has a lot of meaning, and I need to do a lot of research in order to actually know what forensic science actually is. But so far, with the links that I found, I think I am in a good place to not worry about gathering information as I already know about the topic and as I look into the technologies behind it. The **second step** would be on the real **ENP**, in which I am still working on that as I research more about what problems are there in the fornesic science industry and what they still **need to solve** or what **they don't have**. I might just take that chance and think of a way to solve it as the design process might take a lot of time, but I think with the time, it would be worth it to find something that wasn't there before.

# skills #

Some of the skills that I think I have to make this project work are: when it comes to projects like these, I will try and do collaborative work and maybe get inspirational projects from others, as that includes _socializing_ I can also manage my _time_ quite well; I can also _organize_ pretty well; and I can use my _imagination_ with great effect with the _design of art_, which is one of my habits; and I am also quite good at the _writing_ category in case I need to take notes.

## More in detail about my Skills ##

**Socializing**

Either way, with strangers, I can socalize pretty well if they are on the same topic as me, and we can use the time we spend together to solve problems that we both find interesting. In the socialize class, I would say I'm pretty good as Even if there was only one person in the room, I would still at least try to get their attention and get along with them.

**time**

Time to me is very important as i need to schedule plans and gather things most of the time with only myself to help and sometimes it won't come out like i wanted it to but most 90% of the time i can manage time just like today i went for volunteering i asked about what time they start which is about 3-6PM, since my one of my friends doesn't want to go alone, i made myself time as i have clubs on the days she wanted to go but i think with it being ending at 3:30 i can go pretty well on about leaving the club around 3:20 and get their early as 3:40, in which its enough time for us to work as long and I would always make sure I had enough time for my own needs too.

**oraganize**

I would organize for myself but now i'm helping others to organize their things too, just as the start of the year i was asked by my ELA teacher to help and organize his drawers i agreed because back at home i almost do this all the time as i have sections of things for everything.

**Imagination and Art**

I would combine these skills together because I imagine a lot and in my imaginations I would sometimes design them out on a piece of paper and I would call that art as I add more details into my design, whatever is on my mind I will make it into a reality somehow.

**writing**

I liked to write a lot with lots and lots of details included, I just like taking notes in general and hope to understand more throughout my own understand of writing.

# Summary #

Overall of all these thinking i would say im pretty intrigued by this topic that I loved to do as its my first time and my first thing that I actually love and passionate about with science which I hope I can learn more about the human body and get better understanding of it and hope I can imagine in a serious and experimenting field one day that I can both identify body wounds and parts with the meaning behind it!
