# Choosing my Topic #

I chose my topic of **forensic science** as i have a wide passionate of interesting on what the inside of the body looks like with the effects of how it occured, whenever i was little i would go very serious into when they talk about solving cases as those have lots of drama in my opinion im just fairly interested in the crimes that people are involved with and that with me maybe taking a part in it makes it more interesting. Its not too much but for me alwasy blood and gore has alwasy been my favorite shows like those crazy Emergency room hospital shows i would always be up to know the cause of what happended and the full story behind it. I liked science as it was the only subject in which i can go beyound some of my thinking and actually explore new things that are connected behind the topic of specific things. **"crimes"**, are also very interesting as gathering evidence requires hard work but with my _skills_ and perks i think i can handle a task with that. 

Some links that i used for my reasearch would be on a [Overview on forensic science](https://www.nist.gov/forensic-science#:~:text=What%20Is%20Forensic%20Science%3F,to%20anthropology%20and%20wildlife%20forensics) on the basics of what it is then i used a more [detailed Website](https://www.aafs.org/careers-forensic-science/what-forensic-science) on descrbing the thigs you do in fornesic science and that it tells you about the career of it and it even says how much you get paid. Then i researched what forensic has on our society and how does it [provide for the crimes](https://www.strose.edu/forensic-science/forensic-science-criminal-justice/#:~:text=Forensic%20science%20provides%20the%20criminal,further%20analysis%20in%20a%20laboratory.) that are invovled. As of course in order to create and need something that i might create i would look up the [technologies](https://www.atascientific.com.au/technologies-forensic-sciences/#:~:text=Forensic%20scientists%20apply%20technologies%20to,then%20analysed%20using%20gas%20chromatography.) that are already there that to make sure i won't do something that was already done, in the mean time i can learn morea about these technologies and how they work.

The _Engineering Design Process_ might be a bit long as the **first step of defining** that im on which is actually knowing the field of the career and the job behind it has a lot of meaning and i need to a lot of research in order to actually know what forensic science actually is, But so far with the links that i found i would think myself on a good place of not to worry about gathering imformation as i already know about the topic and as i look into the technologies behind it. The **second step** would be on the real **ENP**, in which im still working on that as i research more about what problems are there in the fornesic science industry and what they still **need to solve** or what **they don't have** that i might just use that chance and think of a way to solve it as the design process might use a lot of time but i think with the time, it would be worth it to find something that wasn't there before.

# skills #

Some of the skills that i think i have to make this project work is that when it comes to projects like these i will try and do collabrative work and maybe get inspirational projects from others as that includes _socializing_, I can also manage my _time_ quite well, i can also _organize_ pretty well, and i can use my _imagination_ with great effect with along designing of _art_ in which its one of my habits, as im also quite good in the writing catagory in case i need to take notes.
