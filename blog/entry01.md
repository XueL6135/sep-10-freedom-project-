# Choosing my Topic #

I chose my topic of forensic science as i have a wide passionate of interesting on what the inside of the body looks like with the effects of how it occured, whenever i was little i would go very serious into when they talk about solving cases as those have lots of drama in my opinion im just fairly interested in the crimes that people are involved with and that with me maybe taking a part in it makes it more interesting. Its not too much but for me alwasy blood and gore has alwasy been my favorite shows like those crazy Emergency room hospital shows i would always be up to know the cause of what happended and the full story behind it. I liked science as it was the only subject in which i can go beyound some of my thinking and actually explore new things that are connected behind the topic of specific things. "crimes", are also very interesting as gathering evidence requires hard work but with my skills and perks i think i can handle a task with that. 

Some links that i used for my reasearch would be on a `(Overview on forensic science)[https://www.nist.gov/forensic-science#:~:text=What%20Is%20Forensic%20Science%3F,to%20anthropology%20and%20wildlife%20forensics.]` on the basics of what it is
