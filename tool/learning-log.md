-setting up using '<a-scene>'
-changing up shapes/settin it up using codes like 'a-box/a-cylinder'
-shape inside a shape?
-'Size,position,and scale' matters a lot.

   **Texture**
- '<src = "Texture img link.jpg">'
- colors matter in textures too to see how they would look like.
- '<a-assets>' to add for better quality texture results
- [textures-a place to find them would be this link ](https://www.textures.com/searchq=Brick)
- 'normal-map,normal-texture-repeat,normal-scale' to make the
texture more apealing.
-scale can change the spes into hallow.

what im trying to do.

I have the hand of this of creating shapes
